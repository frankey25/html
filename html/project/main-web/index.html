      	  <p><strong >Sony Interactive Entertainment</strong> (abbreviated as <strong>SIE</strong> and formerly known as <strong>Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.<br/>
      	     (SCEI)</strong> and Sony Network Entertainment) is a multinational video game company and is an owned subsidiary and<br/>
      	      part of the Consumer Products and Services Group of Sony.</p>

      	  <p>The company was founded and established on November 16, 1993, as Sony Computer Entertainment, to handle Sony's<br/>
      	     venture into video game development. Since the successful launch of the original PlayStation console in 1994, <br/>
      	     the company has since been developing the PlayStation lineup of home video game consoles and accessories. Expanding<br/>
      	     upon North America and other countries, the company soon became Sony's main resource for research and  development<br/>
      	     in video games and interactive entertainment. In April 2016, SCE and Sony Network Entertainment was restructured and<br/>
      	     reorganized into Sony Interactive Entertainment, carrying over the operations and primary objectives from both companies.</p>

      	  <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment handles the research and development, production, and sales of both hardware and <br/>
      	     software for the PlayStation video game systems. Alongside, it is also a developer and publisher of video game <br/>
      	     titles and is composed of several subsidiaries of Sony's largest markets: North America, Europe and Asia. As of<br/>
      	     September 30, 2016, the company has overall sold more than 486 million PlayStation consoles worldwide.</p>

       <section class="section2">

       	   <h3 class="h33">PlayStation</h3>
       	   <p>SCEI produces the PlayStation line of video game hardware that consists of consoles and handhelds. Sony's first wide<br/>
       	     home console release, the PlayStation (codenamed "PSX" during development,), was initially designed to be a CD-ROM<br/>
       	     drive add-on for Nintendo's Super NES (a.k.a. "Super Famicom" in Japan) video game console, in response to add-ons <br/>
       	     for competing platforms such as the TurboGrafx-CD and the Sega CD (sold as the PC Engine CD-ROM sup System and<br/>
       	     Mega CD in Japan respectively). When the prospect of releasing the system as an add-on dissolved, Sony redesigned the<br/>
       	     machine into a standalone unit The PlayStation was released in Japan on December 3, 1994, and later in North America<br/>
       	     on September 9, 1995. By the end of the PS console's 12-year production cycle, Sony registered sales of 102 million units</p>

           <h3 class="h33">PlayStation2</h3>
       	   <p>SCE's second home console, the PlayStation 2 (PS2) was released in Japan on March 4, 2000, and later in North America <br/>
       	     and Europe in October and November 2000, respectively. The PS2 is powered by a proprietary central processing unit, the <br/>
       	     Emotion Engine, and was the first video game console to have DVD playback functionality included out of the box.</p>

       	   <p>The PS2 consisted of a DVD drive and retailed in the U.S. for US$299. SCEI received heavy criticism after the launch of <br/>
       	      the PS2 due to the games released as part of the launch, difficulties that it presented for video game designers, and users<br/>
       	      who struggled to port Sega Dreamcast games to the system.However, despite these complaints, the PlayStation 2 received<br/>
       	      widespread support from third party developers throughout its lifespan on the market.</p>

       	   <h3 class="h33">PlayStation Portable</h3>
       	   <p>The PlayStation Portable (PSP) was SCEI's first foray into the small handheld console market. Its development was first<br/>
       	      announced during SCE's E3 conference in 2003, and it was officially unveiled during their E3 conference on May 11, 2004.<br/>
       	      The system was released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in Europe and Australia on <br/>
       	      September 1, 2005. The console has since seen two major redesigns, with new features including a smaller size, more internal<br/>
       	      memory, a better quality LCD screen and a lighter weight.</p>

       	   <h3 class="h33">PlayStation 3</h3>
       	   <p>The launch date for the PS3 was announced by Hirai at the pre-Electronic Entertainment Expo conference held at Sony Pictures<br/>
       	      Studios in Los Angeles, U.S., on May 8, 2006.The PS3 was released in Japan on November 11, 2006, and the U.S. date was November<br/>
       	      17, 2006. Technology journalists observed that Sony had followed what Microsoft did with the Xbox 360, and produced the PS3 in<br/>
       	      two versions: one with a 20GB hard drive and the other with a 60GB hard drive.</p>

       	   <p>The PS3 utilizes a unique processing architecture, the Cell microprocessor, a proprietary technology developed by Sony in conjunction<br/>
       	      with Toshiba and IBM. The graphics processing unit, the RSX 'Reality Synthesizer', was co-developed by Nvidia and Sony. Several<br/>
       	      variations of the PS3 have been released, each with slight hardware and software differences, and each denoted by the varying size<br/>
       	      of the included hard disk drive.</p>

       	    <h3 class="h33">PlayStation Vita</h3>
       	    <p>The PS Vita is the successor to the PlayStation Portable. It was released in Japan and other parts of Asia on December 17, 2011,<br/>
       	       and then in Europe, Australia and North America on February 22, 2012.</p>

            <p>Internally, the Vita features a 4-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a 4-core SGX543MP4+ graphics processing unit, as well <br/>
               as LiveArea software as its main user interface, which succeeds the XrossMediaBar.</p>

            <h3 class="h33">PlayStation 4</h3>
            <p>The PS4 was announced as the successor to the PS3 and was launched in North America on November 15, 2013, in Europe on November 29,<br/>
               2013 and in Japan on February 23, 2014.</p>

            <p>Described by Sony as a "next generation" console, the PS4 included features such as enhanced social capabilities, second-screen<br/>
                options involving devices like the handheld PlayStation Vita, a membership service and compatibility with the Twitch live streaming<br/>
                platform.</p>

            <p>Following a January 2014 announcement by the Chinese government that the country's 14-year game console ban would be lifted, the PS4<br/>
               was scheduled to be the first Sony video game console to be officially and legally released in China since the PlayStation 2 the ban<br/>
               was enacted in 2000 to protect the mental health of young people. Around 70 game developers, including <strong>Ubisoft and Koei</strong>, will service<br/> Chinese PlayStation users.</p>
