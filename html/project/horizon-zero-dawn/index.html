     <p><strong style=" color:  rgb(242, 249, 17)">Horizon Zero Dawn</strong> is an action role-playing video game developed by Guerrilla Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4. The game was released worldwide in 2017.</p>

     <p>The plot revolves around Aloy, a hunter and archer living in a world overrun by robots. Having been outcast her whole life, she sets out to discover the dangers that kept her sheltered. The character makes use of ranged and melee weapons as well as stealth tactics to combat the mechanised creatures, whose remains can also be looted for resources. A skill tree facilitates gameplay improvements. The game features an open world environment for Aloy to explore, divided into tribes that hold side quests to undertake, while the main story guides her throughout the whole world.</p>

     <p>Development began in 2011, with game director Mathijs de Jonge considering it "the most risky" idea of those that were pitched at the time. The concept explores the contrast between the beauty and danger of the game's setting. Guerrilla Games emphasises trial and error as the basis for playing the game, choosing not to implement a tutorial. The game engine, Decima, was previously engineered for Killzone Shadow Fall and altered for Horizon Zero Dawn, the first new intellectual property (IP) developed by Guerrilla Games since Killzone in 2004, and also the studio's first attempt at developing a role-playing game.</p>
     <h3>Gameplay</h3>
     <p>Horizon Zero Dawn is an action role-playing game played from a third-person view. Players take control of Aloy, a huntress and archer, as she progresses through a post-apocalyptic land ruled by robotic creatures known simply as "Machines". Machine components, such as electricity and the metal they are composed of, are vital to Aloy's survival, and she can loot their corpses to find useful resources for crafting.Aloy uses a variety of ways to kill enemies, such as setting traps like tripwires using the Tripcaster, shooting enemies with arrows, using explosives, and melee combat. Weaponry and traps may be purchased from traders. Further, she is essentially able to hack a selection of creatures with the Override Tool, turning them into makeshift vehicles or travelling companions. Aloy can also hide in foliage and ambush nearby enemies to ensure immediate takedowns.A "focus scan" allows Aloy to determine her enemies' susceptibilities, identify their location, the particular level they possess and the nature of loot they will drop. There are three categories in the skill treeâ€”"Prowler" concerns stealth; "Brave" improves combat; and "Forager" increases healing and gathering capabilities.</p>

     <p>The game features an open world with a dynamic day-night cycle and weather system that can be explored without loading screens. Corruption Zones constitute areas that heighten difficulty and are populated by infected Machines that behave with more aggression.To uncover more of the map, one must scale large giraffe-like creatures known as Tallnecks. Twenty-six robotic creature designs are present in the game. Save points and fast travel can be accessed by interacting with campfires, once discovered. The quest structure unfolds to accommodate the exploration of tribes, while the main story covers the entire world. Individual cases are subject to solution as well. A dialogue wheel is used to communicate with non-playable characters.</p>
