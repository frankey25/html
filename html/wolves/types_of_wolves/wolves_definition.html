		 <h2><a name="GW"></a>Gray Wolf</h2>
		 <img src="images/gray_wolf.jpg" width="500" height="302"/>
		       <p>The wolf from which most others arise, the gray wolf is the largest<br/>
		          of the canid species. They can be found in a wide variety of habitats <br/>
		          throughout most of North America.</p>
		       <p>These animals survived the ice age and are thought to be the ancestor<br/>
		          of domestic dog. They may not, however, survive mankind.</p>
		
   	   <h2><a name="AW"></a>Arctic Wolf </h2>
	     <img src="images/arctic_wolf.jpg"/>
		      <p>The Arctic Wolf can be found on the islands of the Canadian Arctic and<br/>
		         the north coast of Greenland. Because of their extreme isolation and the <br/>
		         harsh conditions of their environment, not much is known about this <br/>
		         subspecies of gray wolf.
		      <p>We do know that their coat grows almost pure white and thicker than their <br/>
		         cousins to maximize wamth in constant cold.</p>
		<h2><a name="TW"></a>Tundra Wolf </h2>
		  <img src="images/tundra_wolf.jpg"/>
		      <p>Also called Eurasian Arctic wolf, this animal is found throughout northern<br/>
		         Europe and Asia, often in the arctic and boreal regions of Russia. </p>
		      <p>Among the largest of the grey wolves, these animals have a fine coat of fur<br/>
		         and are often hunted for it.</p>
		<h2><a name="MW"></a>Mexican Wolf</h2>
		  <img  src="images/mexican_wolf.jpg"/>
		      <p>The Mexican wolf is one of the most endangered canids on the planet. Originally <br/>
			     they were found through most of northern Mexico and parts of the Southern US,<br/>
				 and they were declared an endangered species in 1976. </p>
			  <p>What remains of the breed lives in zoos and wolf sanctuaries.</P>
		<h2><a name="GPW"></a>Great Plains Wolf</h2>
          <img  src="images/Great_Plains_Wolf.jpg"/>
              <p>Also called Timber Wolf and Buffalo Wolf, this is the most common subspecies of grey<br/>
			     wolf in the continental US. </p>
              <p>The range of these animals used to cover the whole of the US and southern Canada.<br/>
			     However relentless hunting and habitat destruction has resulted in their protection as<br/>
				 an endangered species. </p>
              <p>Luckily the Great Plains Wolf has made a great comeback and their numbers are rising again. </P>
        <h2><a name="NW"></a>Northwestern Wolf </h2>   
          <img src="images/nr_wolf.jpg"/>
              <p>Also called Rocky Mountain Wolf, McKenzie Valley Wolf, Canadian Wolf and Alaskan Wolf, the<br/>
			     Northwestern Wolf is found in western Canada and in Alaska all the way down the Aleutian Chain. </p>
              <p>Over the past decade 11-20% of the Alaskaâ€™s wolf population is harvested every year thanks to<br/> 
			     people like Sarah Palin. They are predators perfectly suited for their environment, so numbers <br/>
				 remained large in spite of the hunting. </p>	
			 <p>To be honest i always liked wolves.why? Because of the way they treat each other,the love and </br>
			    affection they show to there lovers and puppies,hoe friendly they can be to the pack or <br/>
				when a lone wolf is trying to join the.but what fascinate me the most about wolves is there </br>
				code.</p>
