		      <h3>Cosmos</h3>
		      <p>cosmos were first introduced from Mexico in about 1800, their big,
			  bright daisy flowers have been grown in borders, for cutting and, as
			  shorter and bushier types have been introduced, in containers. They 
			  bring us an invaluable combination of two vital features: they’re 
			  colourful and they’re easy to grow. Almost all the cosmos we grow 
			  derive from just three species: Cosmos bipinnatus, C. sulphureus
			  and C. atrosanguineus.</p>
